# Git and GitHub Project

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates the use of **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and collaborative development. The project follows a structured workflow to illustrate various Git functionalities, such as repository creation, branching, merging, and collaboration using GitHub.

## What is Git?
Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used by software developers to track changes in code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project. 

### Key Features of Git:
- **Distributed System**: Every developer has a local copy of the entire repository and its history.
- **Version Control**: Allows multiple versions of a project to coexist, making it easy to track changes.
- **Branching and Merging**: Developers can create branches to work on separate features and later merge them back into the main codebase.
- **Efficiency**: Designed to handle large projects with speed and minimal storage overhead.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a **web-based platform** built around Git for version control and collaboration. It allows developers to host Git repositories online, making it easier for teams to collaborate on projects and share code with the open-source community.

### Key Features of GitHub:
- **Code Hosting**: A place to store and manage Git repositories online.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on a project simultaneously.
- **Pull Requests**: A way for team members to propose changes to a repository.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub integrates with continuous integration and deployment tools to automate testing and deployment.

## Project Workflow
This project follows a step-by-step Git and GitHub workflow to illustrate the collaboration process among multiple developers.

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Create a New Repository**
2. **Set Up the Repository**
3. **Invite Members to Collaborate**
4. **Accept the Collaboration Invitation**
5. **Develop a Simple Java Program for Addition**
6. **Add the Code to the Repository**
7. **Clone the Repository and Create a New Branch (Abhishek)**
8. **Modify the Code by Adding a Multiplication Function**
9. **Commit and Push the Changes to the Created Branch**
10. **Changes Reflected in the Repository**
11. **Merge Abhishek's Branch to the Main Branch**
12. **Clone the Repository and Create a New Branch (Tanmay)**
13. **Add Changes to the New Branch**
14. **Merge Tanmay's Branch to the Main Branch**
15. **Clone the Repository and Create a New Branch (Saurabh)**
16. **Add Changes to the New Branch**
17. **Merge Saurabh's Branch to the Main Branch**
18. **Final Version of the Main Branch Code**

## Technologies Used
- **Git** for version control
- **GitHub** for hosting and collaboration
- **Java** for developing the sample project

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**
2. **Clone the Forked Repository**
3. **Create a New Branch** (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
4. **Make Changes and Commit** (`git commit -m "Your commit message"`)
5. **Push the Changes** (`git push origin feature-branch`)
6. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub**
